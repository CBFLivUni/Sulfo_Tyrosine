1. compile_all_peptide_ids.py

This reads every PXDXXX_interact-ipro.pep_thresholded.tsv it can find, and just puts into a big dictionary

-- Missing step. Ideally, we would want to have some kind of combined scored, and re-rank peptides on that basis; taking into account best PSM score and PSM count
-- then re-filter for FDR; without this will be inflated FDR. This can already be assessed later in current workflow (decoys carry forward), but cannot be corrected at present,
since scores don't carry forward.

2. Calculate_stats_per_rice_DB.py

python3 Calculate_stats_per_rice_DB.py /home/arjones/hc-storage/PanOryza/proteomics_fasta/2022-07-18-decoys-magic16_plus_contaminants.fasta peptide_to_database_Nov22.txt

This reads the fasta database, and the found peptide ID list from step 1. If there is a match while reading the fasta, it includes a mapping from that peptide to that database;
This uses a complex conditional statement to figure out the source database, based on rules.

3. create_dataset_matrix

python3 create_dataset_matrix.py peptide_to_database_Nov22.txt peptide_to_variety_table.txt

4. Stats per dataset

python3
